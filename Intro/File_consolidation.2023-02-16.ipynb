For example each row will have the x value followed by the 6 y values: x, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6. The input files in this example are DOS tab delimited .txt format.

    "Before we get into the nitty gritty of reading the numerical values from the files, we will read the first five lines from each file and print them to the screen. If we can read each file and their headers to show the files are different, we can move on.\n",
    "\n",

Before you do that, test the block of code on a single file. If that doesn't work, putting it inside a loop will not improve that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand what these statements are doing as this is common to most languages.\n",
    "1. The `open` statement creates an object called a *file handle*. Here that file handle is assigned to the variable `file`, but we could have chosen `BoomerSooner` just as well. The parameter `'r'` tells Python that the file is open for reading and that writing to the file is not allowed. So you cannot accidently over write it.\n",
    "2. `readline()` is a method of the file handle, invoked on the file we just opened as `file.readline()`. Recall this could have been `BoomeSooner.readline()`. `line = file.readline()` reads the contents of the line as a string and assigns it to `line`. \n",
    "3. In the `for jj` loop, we read one line at a time and print it to the display.\n",
    "4. Each time `line = file.readline()` is executed, a new line is read. How does that work? One of the attributes of the file handle is a file pointer, a number that keeps track of where we are in the file. The method `readline()`, after reading a line, advances the file pointer to the beginning of the next line. In this exercise we don't need to worry about the file pointers, because that it handeled by the read/write methods we are using. But there are other methods that independently operate on the file pointer, e.g. moving it to the beginning, the end of the file, or forward and backward by a specified number of bytes.\n",
    "5. `close` is a method telling python AND your operating system that you have released the file. If two different programs are trying to manipulate a file at the same time, the results can be unexpected. To prevent that, opening the file tells the OS that the file is in use. Closing the file tells the OS you are finished with it and then another program can use it. It is very important to close the file when you are done. For example, trying to open a file that is already open generally will give an error.\n",

    "    print(line)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you place the above code inside the loop over files names, you will need to edit something in the code block above to make that work...\n",

Each byte in the file represents a single charcter. There are 256 possible characters. Some are not printable, such as the carraige return, line feed, and tab characters. The full table can be found here: \n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.ascii-code.com/\">extended ASCII table</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The end of the rows are delimited by the sequence of the `carriage return` and `line feed` characters in windows/DOS and the `line feed` character in linux. Usually the end of row delimiter is handled automatically by most functions intended to read text files. After this example we will not worry about the row delimiters in our work. These terms come from the typewriter. It is a good idea to understand these because they are ubiquitous. \n",
    "\n",
    "You just saw the effect of these end of row delimeters (AKA line delimeters) in the example above. The `readline()` method included the end of line delimeters in the string assigned to the `line` variable. The `print()` method already advances the display to the next line. Including the end of like delimeters in the string, casue it to advance two lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python the `carraige return` (or simply *retrun*) is denoted by a two character combination `\\r` and the `line feed` (*next line*) is denoted `\\n`. *Note that the `\\` designates the start of a two character combination denoting a special caracter.*\n",

    "The column delimiter is commonly a `comma`, `space`, or `tab` character. However it could be anything you wish. The restriction is that it must not be a character that could appear in the field of ASCII text. For example, the characters 0123456789.+-eE would be likely appear in the ASCII representation of numeric values and therefore would be poor choices as a delimiter. \n",

    "\n",
    "The task of writing our data to the csv file requires that we understand how floating point numbers are represented as text. We will control that using formatted output. Specifically, we will use the fixed point format, meaning the number of decimal places is fixed and it is not scientific notation. For example, 3.14 and 237.9 are examples of fixed point formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets examine this in more detail. We will use -$\\pi$ which is available in numpy as `np.pi` as out test number. Experiment with this block of code. The second line creates a ruler so you can see the effect of the formating. The caret appears every 5 characters.\n",

    "- There are 4 decimal places.\n",
    "- The last digit is in the 8th column\n",
    "- There is one space before the minus sign\n",
    "- The number is rounded to the last decimal place. ( $\\pi$ = 3.141592...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's parse the format specifier `8.4f`. The *8* is the width of the text field, *4* is the number of decmal places, and *f* specifies fixed point. In order to display any number on the screen, Python must convert it to ASCII text. The format specifier instructs Python how to do that. In this example, the ASCII string is 8 characters wide, with 4 decimal places. To determine the required width for fixed point, you need to also know something about the size of the numbers. For -$\\pi$, you will need one column for the digit on the left of the decimal point, a column for the sign, another for the decimal point, and the 4 decimal places. For a total of 7 columns. That is the minimum width required. In this example we have an extra column on the left. Try changing the format spcifier to `7.4f` and then `8.5f` \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose a width too narrow, Python seems to just expand the width to the minimum required. Some languages enforce the width you chose. In those cases `6.4f` would be two narrow to display `-3.1416` and the output would be a field filled with *#* `######`. Excel does this when the cell width is too narrow to display the number in the cell. **For us, the advantage to choosing a width that works for all our numbers is that the decimals in the csv file will be aligned for easy reading. You will get full credit too!**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The number of decimal places needed for the x and y values.</u> We will need to use the same number of decimal places for the x values that were present in the original files.

Look back at the results from task 3 where you displayed the first five lines of each data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The width needed for the x and y values.</u> To do that we simply need to find the number with the largest magnitude in the x and in the y values. In this example we find the maximum of the absolute value of the x values (first column in `out_data` and the y values (last 6 colums in `out_data`). The numpy functions, max and absolute, function on the entire array or the portion specified.\n",

I need two digits to the left of the decimal plus the sign, the decimal, and the one decimal place (-xx.x) for a width of 5. The format specifier for the x data will be `5.1f`. In y, the format specifier wil be `5.2f`. *Note: In fixed point, you always need at least two columns on the left of the decimal. One for the sign, even if you don't think you need it and a leading zero, even if the largest magnitude is less than 1 (e.g. -0.45).*\n",

    "> `a[:]           # a copy of the whole array` \n",

    "\n",
    "The key point to remember is that the `:stop` value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice. So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n",

    "The other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n",
